### Chapter 3: A Top-Level View of Computer Function and Interconnection

**External Problem**  

A hypothetical computer has the following characteristics:
The processor contains a single general-purpose register, called an accumulator (AC), a Program Counter (PC), a Memory Address Register (MAR), and a Memory Buffer Register (MBR).
Both instructions and data are 16 bits long, so memory words are 16 bits.  
The instruction format provides 4 bits for the opcode and 12 bits for the memory address.

**Opcodes and Operations**  

| Opcode (binary) | Operation |
|-----------------|------------|
| 0000 | Load AC from memory |
| 0001 | Store AC into memory |
| 0010 | Add to AC from memory, result in AC |
| 0011 | Subtract memory from AC, result in AC |
| 0100 | Multiply AC times memory, result in AC |
| 0101 | Divide AC by memory, result in AC |
| 0110 | Logical AND memory and AC, result in AC |
| 0111 | Logical OR memory and AC, result in AC |

**CSE321a – Midterm Exam– Fall 2014**  

Consider a small hypothetical computer with four 16-bit general-purpose registers numbered from 0 to 3. Each machine contains 16 bits (X15-0). The six most-significant bits of the instruction (X15-10) represent an op-code. The following two bits (X9-8) represent a register number. The remaining bits (X7-0) may represent the value or the address of an operand. The following table contains some of the supported op-codes:  

| Mnemonic | Binary Meaning |
|---|---|
| LOAD 011100    | Load register X9-8 from memory location X7-0. |
| STORE 011101   | Store value of register X9-8 to memory location X7-0. |
| ADDLD 110001   | Add value of memory location X7-0 to register X9-8. |
| ADDST 110011   | Add value of register X9-8 to memory location X7-0. |
| DECBRNZ 111010 | Decrement value of register X9-8 by 1, and if new value of register X9-8 is not 0, branch to instruction whose address is X7-0, else continue normally. |

    (a) 0  
    (b) 1  
    (c) 2  
    (d) 3  
    (e) None of the above  

2. Suppose the values of register 2 and location 3A are: `2D15` and `11B5` respectively. What would be their values after executing instruction `763A`?  
    (a) 2D15 and 11B5

**Problem 3.14**

A microprocessor has an increment memory direct instruction, which adds 1 to the value in a memory location. The instruction has five stages: fetch opcode (four bus clock cycles), fetch operand address (three cycles), fetch operand (three cycles), add 1 to operand (three cycles), and store operand (three cycles).  

a. By what amount (in percent) will the duration of the instruction increase if we have to insert two bus wait states in each memory read and memory write operation?  
b. Repeat assuming that the increment operation takes 13 cycles instead of 3 cycles.  

---

**Problem 3.18**

The microprocessor of Problem 3.14 initiates the fetch operand stage of the increment memory direct instruction at the same time that a keyboard actives an interrupt request line. After how long does the processor enter the interrupt processing cycle? Assume a bus clocking rate of 10 MHz.

---

**Interrupt handling**

A given processor has eight interrupt lines (numbered 0-7), and a policy that low-numbered interrupts have priority over higher-numbered ones. The processor takes 10 units of time to handle an interrupt. Suppose the processor starts with no interrupts pending, and the following sequence of interrupts occurs:

| **Interrupt Number** | 2 | 5 | 1 |4 | 0 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Occurrence Time** | 3 | 7 | 11 | 13 | 25 |

**Problem 3.14**

A microprocessor has an increment memory direct instruction, which adds 1 to the value in a memory location. The instruction has five stages: fetch opcode (four bus clock cycles), fetch operand address (three cycles), fetch operand (three cycles), add 1 to operand (three cycles), and store operand (three cycles).  

a. By what amount (in percent) will the duration of the instruction increase if we have to insert two bus wait states in each memory read and memory write operation?  
b. Repeat assuming that the increment operation takes 13 cycles instead of 3 cycles.  


| Stage | Description | Cycles |
|--------|--------------|--------:|
| 1 | Fetch opcode | 4 |
| 2 | Fetch operand address | 3 |
| 3 | Fetch operand | 3 |
| 4 | Add 1 to operand | 3 *(or 13 in part b)* |
| 5 | Store operand | 3 |

Total memory accesses = 4 (three reads + one write).  
Each memory access incurs **2 additional wait states**.

**(a)**  

**Without wait states**  
T1 = 4 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 16 cycles  

**With wait states**  
Extra = 4 memory accesses × 2 wait states = 8 cycles  
T2 = 8 + 16 cycles  

Instruction duration increases by = (T2 - T1) / T1 × 100 = 8 / 16 × 100 = 50%

**(b)** 
**Without wait states**  
T1 = 4 + 3 + 3 + 13 + 3 = 26 cycles  

**With wait states**  
Extra = 4 memory accesses × 2 wait states = 8 cycles  
T2 = 8 + 26 cycles  

Instruction duration increases by = (T2 - T1) / T1 × 100 = 8 / 26 × 100 = 30.77%

**Problem 3.18**

The microprocessor of Problem 3.14 initiates the fetch operand stage of the increment memory direct instruction at the same time that a keyboard actives an interrupt request line. After how long does the processor enter the interrupt processing cycle? Assume a bus clocking rate of 10 MHz.

The interrupt line is checked **only after** the current instruction finishes execution.  
When the interrupt occurs, the processor has just started the **fetch operand** stage, so it must complete the remaining stages first:

| Remaining Stage | Cycles |
|------------------|-------:|
| Fetch operand | 3 |
| Add 1 to operand | 3 |
| Store operand | 3 |
| **Total** | **9 cycles** |

Bus clock frequency: **10 MHz**  
$$
T = \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{10\,\text{MHz}} = 0.1\,\mu s = 100\,\text{ns}
$$

$$
\text{Delay} = 9 \times 100\,\text{ns} = 900\,\text{ns} = 0.9\,\mu s

**Interrupt handling**

A given processor has eight interrupt lines (numbered 0-7), and a policy that low-numbered interrupts have priority over higher-numbered ones. The processor takes 10 units of time to handle an interrupt. Suppose the processor starts with no interrupts pending, and the following sequence of interrupts occurs:

| **Interrupt Number** | 2 | 5 | 1 |4 | 0 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Occurrence Time** | 3 | 7 | 11 | 13 | 25 |

**Solution**  

- disable interrupt method

Service is non-preemptive and handled in arrival order:  

| Interrupt | Arrival | Start | Finish |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | 3 | 3 | 13|
| 5 | 7 | 13| 23|
| 1 | 11| 23| 33|
| 4 | 13| 33| 43|
| 0 | 15| 43| 53|


- priority method

Service is preemptive, allow higher-priority (lower number) interrupts to preempt:

| Interrupt | Arrival | Start | Finish |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | 3 | 3 | 33|
| 5 | 7 | 43| 53|
| 1 | 11| 11| 31|
| 4 | 13| 33| 43|
| 0 | 15| 15| 25|
