| Instruction Type   | Instruction Count | Cycles per Instruction |
|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|

| Data transfer      | 32,000            | 2                       |
| Floating point     | 15,000            | 2                       |

### Chapter 2: Performance Issues  

**Problem 2.10**  
A benchmark program is run on a 40 MHz processor. The executed program consists of 100,000 instruction executions, with the following instruction mix and clock cycle count:  

| Instruction Type   | Instruction Count | Cycles per Instruction |
|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Integer arithmetic | 45,000            | 1                       |
| Data transfer      | 32,000            | 2                       |
| Floating point     | 15,000            | 2                       |
| Control transfer   | 8,000             | 2                       |

Determine the **effective CPI**, **MIPS rate**, and **execution time** for this program.

**Given:**

$$f = 40 \ \text{MHz}, \quad I_c = 100{,}000$$


**1. Average CPI**

$$
CPI_{avg} = \frac{\sum (CPI_x \cdot I_x)}{I_c}
$$

$$
CPI_{avg} = \frac{45{,}000 \cdot 1 + 32{,}000 \cdot 2 + 15{,}000 \cdot 2 + 8{,}000 \cdot 2}{100{,}000}
$$

$$
CPI_{avg} = 1.55 \ \text{cycles/instruction}
$$


**2. MIPS rate**

$$
MIPS = \frac{f}{CPI_{avg} \cdot 10^6}
$$

$$
MIPS = \frac{40}{1.55} \approx 25.8 \ \text{million instructions/sec}
$$


**3. Execution time**

$$
T_p = \frac{I_c \cdot CPI_{avg}}{f}
$$

$$
T_p = \frac{100{,}000 \cdot 1.55}{40 \times 10^6} = 3.875 \times 10^{-3} \ \text{sec} = 3.875 \ \text{ms}
$$

**Problem 2.14**  
The following table shows the execution times (in seconds) for five different benchmark programs on three machines.  

| Benchmark | R     | M     | Z     |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|
| E         | 417   | 244   | 134   |
| F         | 83    | 70    | 70    |
| H         | 66    | 153   | 135   |
| I         | 39449 | 35527 | 66000 |
| K         | 772   | 368   | 369   |

a. Compute the speed metric for each processor for each benchmark, normalized to machine **R**. That is, the ratio for R are all 1.0. Other ratios are calculated with R treated as the reference system.\
b. Repeat part (a) using **M** as the reference machine.\
c. Which machine is the slowest based on each of the preceding two calculations? \

$$
r_x = \frac{T_{ref}}{T_{sut}}
$$

$$
r_g = \Bigg(\prod_{i=1}^{n} r_{x,i}\Bigg)^{\tfrac{1}{n}}
$$


#### Case 1: Using R as reference machine

| Benchmark | r_M  | r_Z  |
|-----------|------|------|
| E         | 1.71 | 3.11 |
| F         | 1.19 | 1.19 |
| H         | 0.43 | 0.49 |
| I         | 1.11 | 0.60 |
| K         | 2.10 | 2.09 |

$$
r_g(M) = (1.71 \times 1.19 \times 0.43 \times 1.11 \times 2.10)^{\tfrac{1}{5}} \approx 1.15
$$

$$
r_g(Z) = (3.11 \times 1.19 \times 0.49 \times 0.60 \times 2.09)^{\tfrac{1}{5}} \approx 1.18
$$

So, relative to R ‚Üí both M and Z are faster, with **Z slightly faster than M**.


#### Case 2: Using M as reference machine

| Benchmark | r_R  | r_Z  |
|-----------|------|------|
| E         | 0.59 | 1.82 |
| F         | 0.84 | 1.00 |
| H         | 2.32 | 1.13 |
| I         | 0.90 | 0.54 |
| K         | 0.48 | 1.00 |

$$
r_g(R) = (0.59 \times 0.84 \times 2.32 \times 0.90 \times 0.48)^{\tfrac{1}{5}} \approx 0.87
$$

$$
r_g(Z) = (1.82 \times 1.00 \times 1.13 \times 0.54 \times 1.00)^{\tfrac{1}{5}} \approx 1.02
$$

So, relative to M ‚Üí **R is slower**, and **Z is slightly faster than M**.

From both calculations:

- **R** is the slowest machine.  
- **Z** is the fastest overall.

> üìò **Note:** All calculations are approximated to **two decimal places**.

**External Problem**  
Given that 30% of a certain program could be executed in parallel, calculate the **speed-up factor** due to executing that program on 8 processors/cores instead of a single processor. 

We use **Amdahl's Law**:

$$
\text{SpeedUp} = \frac{1}{(1 - f) + \frac{f}{N}}
$$


$$
\text{SpeedUp} = \frac{1}{(1 - 0.30) + \frac{0.30}{8}} \approx 1.3559
$$
