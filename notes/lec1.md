### Architecture vs. Organization  

**Architecture**  
- The **conceptual (functional) design** of the computer system as seen by the programmer.  
- Describes **what the system does**.  
- Examples:  
  - Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)  
  - Data types  
  - Registers  
  - Addressing modes  
  - I/O mechanisms visible to software  

**Organization**  
- The **implementation details** of the architecture.  
- Describes **how the system is built internally**.  
- Examples:  
  - Datapath, control signals  
  - Memory hierarchy  
  - Pipelining  
  - Physical arrangement of components  

**Critical Thinkingüí°**  
- When we say *single-cycle* or *multi-cycle*, is that an **architecture** or an **organization**?  
- Is MIPS considered an **architecture** or an **organization**?

### Structure vs. Function  

**Structure**  
- How the components are related to each other.  

**Function**  
- The operation of individual components.  
- Four core functions of any computer:  
  1. Data Processing  
  2. Data Storage  
  3. Data Movement  
  4. Control

### Computer Evolution and Performance  

**Parameters affecting performance:**  
1. System clock speed ($f$)  
2. Instruction count ($I_c$)  
3. Cycles per instruction ($CPI$)  


Since CPI varies across instructions, we use the **average CPI**:  

$$
CPI_{avg} = \frac{\sum (CPI_x \cdot I_x)}{I_c}
$$  

---

**Performance Metrics**

1. **Instructions per second (IPS, \(R_i\))**  

$$
T_i = \frac{CPI}{f}, \quad R_i = \frac{1}{T_i} \ \text{instructions/sec}
$$  

2. **Million instructions per second (MIPS, \(R_m\))**  

$$
R_m = \frac{R_i}{10^6}
$$  

3. **Programs per second (PPS, \(R_p\))**  

$$
T_p = T_i \cdot I_c, \quad R_p = \frac{1}{T_p}
$$  

> üìò **Note:** These performance metrics are valid for analyzing a **single system**.  
> They cannot be directly used to compare **different systems** because of differences in manufacturers, architectures, and instruction sets.  
> To compare across systems, we use **benchmark programs**.

### Benchmark Programs  

- Written in high-level language.  
- Designed in different styles and widely distributed.  
- Used to compare machines with a common workload.  

Definitions:  
- $T_{ref}$ = runtime on the **reference machine**  
- $T_{sut}$ = runtime on the **system under test**  

Relative speed:  

$$
r_x = \frac{T_{ref}}{T_{sut}}
$$  

Geometric mean speed:  

$$
r_g = \Bigg(\prod_{i=1}^{n} r_{x,i}\Bigg)^{\tfrac{1}{n}}
$$  

> üìò **Note:** The larger the $r_g$, the faster the **system under test** compared to the reference machine.

### Amdahl's Law  

If a program takes time \(T\) on a single processor and only a fraction \(f\) can be executed in parallel on \(N\) processors:  

$$
\text{SpeedUp} = \frac{1}{(1 - f) + \tfrac{f}{N}}
$$  

Maximum speedup (as $N \to \infty$):  


$$
\text{SpeedUp}_{max} = \frac{1}{1 - f}
$$
